# Assignment 1

1. Prove that if $G$ is a graph of order at least 5, then $G$ and its complement $\bar G$ cannot both be bypartite.
2. Prove that if two graphs $G$ and $H$ are connected, then their cartesian product $G\times H$ is also connected. Also establish a relation between the diameters of the three graphs.
3. Can we have a graph of order $6$ with $\delta(G) = 1$, $\Delta(G) = 5$, and at least three vertices of degree $4$? Either explicitly construct such a graph, or prove that it is not possible.
