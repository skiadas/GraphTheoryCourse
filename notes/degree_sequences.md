# Degree sequences

- Read 2.3, pages 43-47
    - What do we refer to as **degree sequence** of a graph?
    - Write down all possible degree sequences for all graphs of order 2, 3 and 4.
    - True or False: all sequences of non-negative numbers are **graphical**
    - Theorem 2.10 describes a process of testing if a non-increasing sequence is graphical.
        - Carry out that process to determine if the sequence $3,3,2,1,1$ is graphical. If it is, construct a graph with that sequence.
        - Prove the backward direction of the theorem: If the constructed sequence $s_1$ is graphical, then we can explicitly construct a graph for the original sequence $s$ by extending the graph for $s_1$.
        - Prove the forward direction of the theorem: If $s$ is graphical, show that $s_1$ is also graphical by suitable manipulation of the graph corresponding to $s$. There are two cases to distinguish: If there is a graph with degree sequence $s$ where a vertex of degree $d_1$ is connected to the vertices with the next $d_1$ degrees, i.e. $d_2, d_3, \cdots, d_{d_1+1}$, and if there is no such graph. In particular, make sure you understand the meaning of the diamond graphs in Figure 2.15.
