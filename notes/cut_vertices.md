# Cut Vertices

- Read section 5.1, pages 107-110
    - What vertices do we call **cut-vertices** of a graph?
    - Which vertices are cut-vertices in path, cycle and complete graphs?
    - Which vertices are cut-vertices in a tree?
    - Are the vertices incident to a bridge necessarily cut-vertices?
    - Are the edges incident to a cut vertex necessarily bridges?
    - What is the smallest graph you can make with a cut-vertex?
    - Prove theorem 5.1: A vertex that is incident to a bridge is a cut-vertex if and only if its degrees is at least 2.
    - Prove corollary 5.2: A connected graph of order at least 3 with a bridge must also have a cut-vertex.
    - Prove theorem 5.3: $v$ is a cut-vertex and we consider two vertices on different components of $G-v$, then every path in $G$ joining those vertices must pass through $v$.
    - Prove corollary 5.4: A vertex is a cut-vertex if and only if there are two vertices distinct from it so that every path joining them passes through it.
    - Prove theorem 5.5: If we consider a vertex of a graph $G$, then the vertex that is the farthest from it is not a cut-vertex.
    - Prove corollary 5.6: Every nontrivial connected graph contains at least two vertices that are not cut-vertices.
