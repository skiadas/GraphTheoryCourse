# Strong Digraphs

- Read section 7.1, pages 161-168
- What is a **digraph**, **arc**, **oriented graph**?
- When do we say that a vertex $u$ is **adjacent to** a vertex $v$? When do we say that it is **adjacent from** $v$?
- What are the **indegree** and **outdegree** of a vertex?
- What does the **first theorem of digraph theory** say?
- What is a **directed walk/trail/path/circuit**?
- When do we say that a directed graph is **weakly connected**?
- When do we say that a directed graph is **strongly connected**?
- Show examples of graphs that are weakly, but not strongly, connected.
- What is the **directed distance** from $u$ to $v$? Is it a symmetric function?
- Why is it the case that if a digraph is strongly connected then each vertex has positive out- and in-degrees?
- Theorem 7.3: A digraph is strong if and only if it contains a closed spanning (directed) walk.
- What is an **Eulerian Circuit**? What is an **Eulerian Graph**?
- Theorem 7.4: A nontrivial connected digraph is Eulerian if and only if on each vertex the outdegree equals the indegree.
- What is an **orientation** for a nontrivial connected graph?
- Theorem 7.5: A nontrivial connected graph $G$ has a strong orientation if and only if it contains no bridges.
- Practice problems: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
