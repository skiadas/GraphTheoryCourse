# Graph Isomorphism

- Read 3.1, pages 55-61
    - What is the technical definition of saying that two graphs $G,H$ are **isomorphic**?
    - Do isomorphic graphs have the same order? size? degree sequence?
    - Can we have two graphs with the same order and size, but not isomorphic?
    - Show that two graphs are isomorphic if and only if their complements are isomorphic.
    - Can a graph be isomorphic to its complement?
    - Can we have two graphs with the same degree sequences, but not isomorphic? What if they are also both connected graphs?
    - List the various ways presented in this chapter with which we can test that two graphs are not isomorphic.
    - How do we define isomorphism for digraphs?
