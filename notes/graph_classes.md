    - What graph do we call a **path**? How is it denoted?
        - What relation must there be between the order and the size in a path graph?
        - Is a graph that has this order-size relation necessarily a path graph? What about if it is a connected graph?
        - How many paths are there in the path graph of order $n$?
    - What graph do we call a **circle**? How is it denoted?
        - What relation must there be between the order and the size in a cycle graph?
        - Is a graph that has this order-size relation necessarily a cycle graph? What about if it is a connected graph?
    - What graph do we call **complete**? How is it denoted?
        - What relation must there be between the order and the size in a complete graph?
        - Is a graph that has this order-size relation necessarily a complete graph?
    - What is the **complement** of a graph? How is it denoted?
        - How many edges does the complement of a graph have?
        - Prove theorem 1.11: If $G$ is a disconnected graph, then $\bar G$ is connected.
        - If $G$ is a connected graph, is it necessary that $\bar G$ be disconnected?
        - If $\bar G$ is connected, is it necessary that $G$ be disconnected?
    - What graph do we call **bipartite**? What graph do we call **complete bipartite**?
        - How many complete bipartite subgraphs does the complete graph on 5 vertices have? Can you extend this to $n$ vertices?
        - Prove or disprove: Every path graph of order at least $2$ is bipartite.
        - When can a cycle graph be bipartite? Prove your answer.
        - Prove theorem 1.12: a nontrivial graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycles.
    - Two ways to construct new graphs from two existing graphs are the **join** and the **cartesian product**. Explain what those are and demonstrate for $C_3$ combined with $C_3$.
        - The join of two empty graphs has another name. What is that name?
    - Define the $n$-cube graphs $Q_n$, and draw the graphs for $n\leq 4$.
    - Practice problems: 1.24, 1.25, 1.27, 1.28
- Read 1.4, pages 26-28
    - How does a **multigraph** differ from a "normal" graph?
    - How does a **pseudograph** differ from a multigraph and from a "normal" graph?
    - What is a **digraph**, and how does it differ from a "normal" graph?
        - When is such a graph called **oriented**?
        - We can define many of the terms from graphs to this context. For instance define what a **walk**, **path**, a **cycle** would mean in a *digraph*, and what **geodesic arcs** would mean, and what the **diameter** would be.
