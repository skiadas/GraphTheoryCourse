2. *Hall's condition*. Theorem 8.3 with its proof.
3. Restatement of theorem 8.3 as theorem 8.4 and theorem 8.5.
4. Theorem 8.6
5. edge/vertex independence numbers and edge/vertex covering numbers definitions.
6. When is a graph called *planar*? What are the *regions* for such a graph, and what is the *boundary* of such a region?
