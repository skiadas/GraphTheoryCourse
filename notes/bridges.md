# Bridges

- Read 4.1, pages 85-87
    - When is an edge called a **bridge**?
    - Can an edge that reaches a leaf vertex be a bridge?
    - Identify the bridges for:
        - path graphs
        - cycle graphs
        - complete graphs
    - Can a disconnected graph have bridges?
    - Is this a valid restatement of an edge $e$ being a bridge for a graph $G$: "the two vertices incident to the edge are on different components of the graph $G-e$"
    - Prove theorem 4.1: An edge is a bridge if and only if it lies on no cycle of the graph.
    - Practice problems: 4.1, 4.2 (Exercise 2.9 can help here), 4.5a (induction on $n$)
    - True or False: If $H$ is a spanning subgraph of $G$, and $e$ is an edge in $H$ which is a bridge in $G$, then it is also a bridge in $H$. What about the other way around?
    - True or False: A graph cannot have exactly one non-bridge edge.
    - Challenge problems: 4.5b, 4.6
