# Trees

- Read 4.2, pages 87-92
    - When is a graph $G$ called **acyclic**? What's another name for such graphs?
    - When is a graph $G$ called a **tree**?
    - Draw all trees of orders $3$ and $4$.
    - How can we define a tree alternatively using bridges instead of cycles?
    - What trees do we call **stars**, **double-stars**, **caterpillars**?
    - How does a **rooted tree** differ from a tree?
    - Prove theorem 4.2: A graph is a tree if and only if every two vertices are connected by a unique path.
    - Prove theorem 4.3: Every nontrivial tree has at least two end-vertices (leaves).
        - How does this theorem help us prove facts about trees?
    - Prove theorem 4.4: Every tree of order $n$ has size $n-1$.
    - Study example 4.5
    - Prove corollary 4.6: Every forest of order $n$ with $k$ components has size $n-k$.
    - Practice problems: 4.7, 4.8, 4.13, 4.14
    - Prove theorem 4.7: Every connected graph of order $n$ has size at least $n-1$.
    - Prove theorem 4.8: If $G$ is a graph of order $n$ and size $m$, then any two of the following imply that the graph is a tree (and hence also imply the third):
        a. $G$ is connected
        b. $G$ is acyclic
        c. $m=n-1$
    - Prove theorem 4.9: If $T$ is a tree of order $k$, then $T$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of any graph $G$ with $\delta(G) \geq k-1$.
    - Practice problems: 4.20, 4.22
