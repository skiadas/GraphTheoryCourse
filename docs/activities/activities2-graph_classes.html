<li>Consider the complete graph in <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> vertices. In each of the following explain your reasoning.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Determine how many path subgraphs of this graph there are (these would be identical to <span class="math inline">\(P_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P_3\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(P_4\)</span>, count separately for each case). </li>
<li>Determine how many cycle subgraphs of this graph there are (<span class="math inline">\(C_3\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span>, count separately for each case). </li>
<li>Determine how many complete proper subgraphs of this graph there are (<span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(K_3\)</span>, count separately for each case). </li>
</ol></li>
<li>Can the complement of a path/cycle graph be a path/cycle graph? Explain (there are 4 combinations in this question). </li>
<li>Consider a bipartite graph of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. What is the largest possible value for the size of such a graph? Prove your answer (you may end up using some basic calculus). </li>
<li>Prove that for every <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th cube is bipartite. You will likely need to do induction on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to formally prove it, but try to get some intuition by manually trying the cases up to <span class="math inline">\(n\leq 3\)</span>. </li>

<li>Consider a digraph whose vertices are the courses offered in a department (say mathematics, but your answers below should apply to <em>any</em> department), and where an arc/edge from <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> indicates that the course <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> has the course <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> as a prerequisite.

<li>Must such a digraph be <strong>oriented</strong>? Explain. </li>
<li>What does it mean to have multiple edges <em>from</em> the same vertex? What does it mean to have multiple edges <em>to</em> the same vertex? </li>
<li>Can such a digraph have a directed cycle in it? </li>
<li>What practical significance does the diameter in such a digraph have? </li>
