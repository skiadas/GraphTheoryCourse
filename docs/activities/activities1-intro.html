<li>Consider the courses that each of the students in this class is taking. Assume that all these courses will have a final exam. We want to figure out how many different time slots we would need to use. Two courses <em>cannot</em> go in the same time slot if they are in the same department, or if a student is taking both of them.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Draw a graph whose vertices are to be the different courses, and where we draw an edge between two graphs if they <em>cannot</em> go in the same time slot because of the two reasons above. </li>
<li>Using the graph, determine what the smallest number of time slots we would need is, and justify your answer. </li>
<li>Can we abstract away the key elements in this problem, so we can apply them to other settings? Can you express this problem purely in terms of graphs? </li>

<li>Describe at least three different proper subgraphs of the graph in question 1. At least one of these should be an <em>induced</em> subgraph, and at least one should not. </li>
<li>Is the graph we constructed in question 1 connected? Did it necessarily <em>have</em> to be connected? Explain. </li>
<li>What is the diameter of the graph in question 1? </li>
