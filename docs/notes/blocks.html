<h1 id="blocks">Blocks</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read section 5.2, pages 111-114
<ul>
<li>When do we call a graph <strong>nonseparable</strong>?</li>
<li>Prove theorem 5.7: A graph of order at least <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> is nonseparable if and only if every two vertices lie on a common cycle.
<ul>
<li>In the forward direction part of the proof, the case of <span class="math inline">\(d(u, v)=1\)</span> is handled right-away by the fact that the graph has no bridges. Explain.</li>
<li>Explain how the inductive step for that direction works, in particular figure 5.3.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What do we refer to as a <strong>block</strong> in a separable graph?</li>
<li>What are the blocks in a path graph? In a cycle graph? A complete graph?</li>
<li>Looking at Figure 5.4, make sure you understand why the identified graphs are blocks.</li>
<li>Practice on exercise 5.9.</li>
<li>If a vertex is a cut-vertex of a graph, is it also a cut-vertex of any induced subgraph that contains it?</li>
<li>Prove theorem 5.8: The relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> on edges defined by <span class="math inline">\(e R f\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(e=f\)</span> or if <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> lie on the same cycle is in fact an equivalence relation. You will need to show it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Make sure to draw a graph of the proof of transitivity.</li>
<li>Show that the graph induced by the edges of any one of the equivalence classes is a block (i.e.Â you have to show that it is nonseparable, and also that it cannot be extended).</li>
<li>Prove corollary 5.9: Distinct blocks are edge-disjoint, have at most one vertex in common, and if they do have a vertex in common then it is a cut-vertex of the graph.</li>
<li>Work out exercise 5.10.</li>
<li>Practice problems: 5.12, 5.13</li>
</ul></li>
