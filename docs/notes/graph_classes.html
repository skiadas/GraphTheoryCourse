<h1 id="classes-of-graphs">Classes of Graphs</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read 1.3, pages 19-24
<ul>
<li>What graph do we call a <strong>path</strong>? How is it denoted?
<ul>
<li>What relation must there be between the order and the size in a path graph?</li>
<li>Is a graph that has this order-size relation necessarily a path graph? What about if it is a connected graph?</li>
<li>How many paths are there in the path graph of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What graph do we call a <strong>circle</strong>? How is it denoted?
<ul>
<li>What relation must there be between the order and the size in a cycle graph?</li>
<li>Is a graph that has this order-size relation necessarily a cycle graph? What about if it is a connected graph?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What graph do we call <strong>complete</strong>? How is it denoted?
<ul>
<li>What relation must there be between the order and the size in a complete graph?</li>
<li>Is a graph that has this order-size relation necessarily a complete graph?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the <strong>complement</strong> of a graph? How is it denoted?
<ul>
<li>How many edges does the complement of a graph have?</li>
<li>Prove theorem 1.11: If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a disconnected graph, then <span class="math inline">\(\bar G\)</span> is connected.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a connected graph, is it necessary that <span class="math inline">\(\bar G\)</span> be disconnected?</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\bar G\)</span> is connected, is it necessary that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be disconnected?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What graph do we call <strong>bipartite</strong>? What graph do we call <strong>complete bipartite</strong>?
<ul>
<li>How many complete bipartite subgraphs does the complete graph on 5 vertices have? Can you extend this to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices?</li>
<li>Prove or disprove: Every path graph of order at least <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is bipartite.</li>
<li>When can a cycle graph be bipartite? Prove your answer.</li>
<li>Prove theorem 1.12: a nontrivial graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Two ways to construct new graphs from two existing graphs are the <strong>join</strong> and the <strong>cartesian product</strong>. Explain what those are and demonstrate for <span class="math inline">\(C_3\)</span> combined with <span class="math inline">\(C_3\)</span>.
<ul>
<li>The join of two empty graphs has another name. What is that name?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Define the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-cube graphs <span class="math inline">\(Q_n\)</span>, and draw the graphs for <span class="math inline">\(n\leq 4\)</span>.</li>
<li>Practice problems: 1.24, 1.25, 1.27, 1.28</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read 1.4, pages 26-28
<ul>
<li>How does a <strong>multigraph</strong> differ from a “normal” graph?</li>
<li>How does a <strong>pseudograph</strong> differ from a multigraph and from a “normal” graph?</li>
<li>What is a <strong>digraph</strong>, and how does it differ from a “normal” graph?
<ul>
<li>When is such a graph called <strong>oriented</strong>?</li>
<li>We can define many of the terms from graphs to this context. For instance define what a <strong>walk</strong>, <strong>path</strong>, a <strong>cycle</strong> would mean in a <em>digraph</em>, and what <strong>geodesic arcs</strong> would mean, and what the <strong>diameter</strong> would be.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
