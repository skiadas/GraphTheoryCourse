<h1 id="cut-vertices">Cut Vertices</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read section 5.1, pages 107-110
<ul>
<li>What vertices do we call <strong>cut-vertices</strong> of a graph?</li>
<li>Which vertices are cut-vertices in path, cycle and complete graphs?</li>
<li>Which vertices are cut-vertices in a tree?</li>
<li>Are the vertices incident to a bridge necessarily cut-vertices?</li>
<li>Are the edges incident to a cut vertex necessarily bridges?</li>
<li>What is the smallest graph you can make with a cut-vertex?</li>
<li>Prove theorem 5.1: A vertex that is incident to a bridge is a cut-vertex if and only if its degrees is at least 2.</li>
<li>Prove corollary 5.2: A connected graph of order at least 3 with a bridge must also have a cut-vertex.</li>
<li>Prove theorem 5.3: <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is a cut-vertex and we consider two vertices on different components of <span class="math inline">\(G-v\)</span>, then every path in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> joining those vertices must pass through <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</li>
<li>Prove corollary 5.4: A vertex is a cut-vertex if and only if there are two vertices distinct from it so that every path joining them passes through it.</li>
<li>Prove theorem 5.5: If we consider a vertex of a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, then the vertex that is the farthest from it is not a cut-vertex.</li>
<li>Prove corollary 5.6: Every nontrivial connected graph contains at least two vertices that are not cut-vertices.</li>
<li>Work out problems 5.1, 5.2</li>
<li>Practice problems: 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6</li>
</ul></li>
