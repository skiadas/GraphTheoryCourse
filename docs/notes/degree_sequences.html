<h1 id="degree-sequences">Degree sequences</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read 2.3, pages 43-47
<ul>
<li>What do we refer to as <strong>degree sequence</strong> of a graph?</li>
<li>Write down all possible degree sequences for all graphs of order 2, 3 and 4.</li>
<li>True or False: all sequences of non-negative numbers are <strong>graphical</strong></li>
<li>Theorem 2.10 describes a process of testing if a non-increasing sequence is graphical.
<ul>
<li>Carry out that process to determine if the sequence <span class="math inline">\(3,3,2,1,1\)</span> is graphical. If it is, construct a graph with that sequence.</li>
<li>Prove the backward direction of the theorem: If the constructed sequence <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> is graphical, then we can explicitly construct a graph for the original sequence <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> by extending the graph for <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Prove the forward direction of the theorem: If <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is graphical, show that <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> is also graphical by suitable manipulation of the graph corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. There are two cases to distinguish: If there is a graph with degree sequence <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> where a vertex of degree <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> is connected to the vertices with the next <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> degrees, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(d_2, d_3, \cdots, d_{d_1+1}\)</span>, and if there is no such graph. In particular, make sure you understand the meaning of the diamond graphs in Figure 2.15.</li>

<li>Study example 2.11 on page 46.</li>
<li>Problems to work on: 2.31, 2.32</li>
