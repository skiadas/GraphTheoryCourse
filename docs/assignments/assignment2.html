<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Recall that <span class="math inline">\(\delta(G)\)</span> denotes the smallest degree of any vertex in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta(G)\)</span> denotes the largest degree.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Establish a relation between <span class="math inline">\(\delta(\bar G)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta(G)\)</span>. This should be a formula that allows us to compute one from the other.</li>
<li>Prove that if <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\delta(G) + \delta(\bar G) \leq n-1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Prove that equality in the previous part holds if and only if <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is regular.</li>
<li>Prove that a graph of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is regular if and only if there is a vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> such that its degree in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\delta(G)\)</span> and its degree in <span class="math inline">\(\bar G\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\delta(\bar G)\)</span>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>We want to find all non-isomorphic <em>connected</em> graphs of order <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and size <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>First determine all possible degree sequences for such graphs. You should find five possible degree sequences, four of which are graphical. Two of those have a vertex of degree <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, and two have one or more vertices of degree <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</li>
<li>Construct the two graphs corresponding to the degree sequences for the two sequences that have a vertex of degree <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, and prove that there are no other such graphs (hint: there is only one way the vertex of degree <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> can be added to a smaller graph to obtain the desired graph).</li>
<li>From the two sequences that have only vertices of degree at most <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, one has only one possible graph corresponding to it, and the other has two. You must find those graphs and prove that they are the only possibilities (hint: think of what vertices one of the degree-3 vertices can connect to).</li>
<li>You should have found a total of five different graphs. Make sure to draw the graphs in as symmetric a way as possible. Also determine which of these graphs are bipartite.</li>
