### Section 2.3

1. Exercise 2.31: Prove that a sequence $d_1,d_2,\cdots,d_n$ is graphical if and only if the sequence $n-d_1-1,n-d_2-1,\cdots,n-d_n-1$ is graphical (after the suitable reordering).
    \vfill
2. Exercise 2.34:
    a. Determine for which integers $x$, if any, the sequence $7,6,5,4,3,2,1,x$ is graphical. You may need to reposition $x$ to make sure the sequence is non-decreasing. Remember that you can also use the first theorem of graph theory to exclude some possible values without much work.
    \vfill
    \newpage
    b. For each of the integers $x$ described above, construct the corresponding graph by following the steps at the beginning of the proof of theorem 2.10.
