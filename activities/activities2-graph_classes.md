## Section 1.3

1. Consider the complete graph in $5$ vertices. In each of the following explain your reasoning.
    a. Determine how many path subgraphs of this graph there are (these would be identical to $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$ or $P_4$, count separately for each case).
    \vfill
    b. Determine how many cycle subgraphs of this graph there are ($C_3$ or $C_4$, count separately for each case).
    \vfill
    \newpage
    c. Determine how many complete proper subgraphs of this graph there are ($K_1$ through $K_3$, count separately for each case).
    \vfill
2. Can the complement of a path/cycle graph be a path/cycle graph? Explain (there are 4 combinations in this question).
\vfill
\newpage
3. Consider a bipartite graph of order $n$. What is the largest possible value for the size of such a graph? Prove your answer (you may end up using some basic calculus).
\vfill
4. Prove that for every $n$, the $n$-th cube is bipartite. You will likely need to do induction on $n$ to formally prove it, but try to get some intuition by manually trying the cases up to $n\leq 3$.
\vfill

## Section 1.4

4. Consider a digraph whose vertices are the courses offered in a department (say mathematics, but your answers below should apply to *any* department), and where an arc/edge from $u$ to $v$ indicates that the course $v$ has the course $u$ as a prerequisite.
    a. Must such a digraph be **oriented**? Explain.
    \vfill
    b. What does it mean to have multiple edges *from* the same vertex? What does it mean to have multiple edges *to* the same vertex?
    \vfill
    c. Can such a digraph have a directed cycle in it?
    \vfill
    d. What practical significance does the diameter in such a digraph have?
